******************* NOTES *******************
Due of time limitation, I couldn't do everything required in the test and below are description for what left and what I was planning to do.
1) I added few unit and integeration tests just as examples. For the limit of time, I couldn't add more. I added signature for test methods for AppointmentController in order to give insight of my test cases.
2) Request params validations need to be added. I handled some but not all.
3) Some use cases need to be handled and I added //TODO comments in the code for them.
4) Response error exceptions need to be handled more. I handled only one as an example.
5) I added the most important database validation for the models but still some validations can be added (incase you see something missing)
6) Tests have some redendency code and it can be refactored in a better way if there is enough time.
7) API DOCS using Swagger is missing. I used it before with Ruby on Rails and the idea is just matter of time to apply it correctly and write proper integration tests for it.
